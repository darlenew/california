A custom text calendar printer.

Happy New Year.  California helps you plan for the future, one day at a time.  Print out a custom calendar or save it to a text file to edit.  Edit this script to make your own calendar format, or use the already generated calabazas-2017.txt.

I personally prefer to edit a text file instead of using calendaring software, since I like to include things like events, short to-do reminders, exercise logs, and other notes in one place.  Keeping this calendar file on iCloud or Google Drive ensures that it syncs between my devices.
